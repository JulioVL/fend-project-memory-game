## Description

The following project was made for the **Udacity's Front End Web Developer Nanodegree**.
It is based on a card game that allows the user to interact with a grid of cards with the goal of _matching them all_.

## Instructions


### Install instructions
- To download the game you can visit the following website: [Memory Card Game](https://github.com/JulioVL/fend-project-memory-game).
- Clone it and open index.html
...
$ git clone https://github.com/JulioVL/fend-project-memory-game.git
...

### Game instructions
- The board will show show 8 pairs of cards (16 in total) that you have to flip in order to find their match.
- Every time you select two equal cards, they will stay flipped over; but, every time you fail, both cards will flip down.
- When you match them all, a congratulation message box will appear indicating the number of stars you got and the time you used.
- If you like, you can start again the game every time you want with the reload button (that is also in the congratulation message).
